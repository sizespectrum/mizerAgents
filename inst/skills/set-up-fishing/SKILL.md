description: >-
  Set up or change fishing in a mizer model — gears, selectivity curves,
  catchability, and effort. Use whenever the user wants to define fishing gears,
  choose or configure a selectivity function (knife_edge, sigmoid_length,
  double_sigmoid_length, sigmoid_weight), set which gear catches which species,
  change catchability, or set the baseline fishing effort with setFishing() and
  the gear_params data frame.

# Setting up fishing

Fishing mortality in mizer is `F[g,i](w) = S[g,i](w) * Q[g,i] * E[g]` — a gear's
**selectivity** at size, times its **catchability** for a species, times its
**effort**. You configure the first two through the `gear_params` data frame and
`setFishing()`; effort at run time is handled in the `run-simulation` skill.

Setter functions return a new `MizerParams` — always reassign.

## The `gear_params` data frame

One row per **gear–species combination** (a gear that catches three species
contributes three rows). Required columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `gear` | gear name |
| `species` | species this row applies to |
| `sel_func` | name of the selectivity function (e.g. `"sigmoid_length"`) |
| `catchability` | scales `F` for this gear–species pair (default 1) |

Plus **one column per parameter of the chosen `sel_func`**, named exactly like
the function's argument (see below). Read/replace the table with
`gear_params(params)` / `gear_params(params) <- ...`.

```r
gp <- gear_params(params)
gp["Cod, Otter", "catchability"] <- 0.8   # row names are "species, gear"
gear_params(params) <- gp
```

**Setting one up from scratch.** Assign a fresh data frame with one row per
gear–species combination. Only `species` is strictly required: `gear` defaults to
the species name, `sel_func` to `knife_edge`, `catchability` to 1, and the
`knife_edge` cut-off to `w_mat`. You must, however, supply the parameter columns
of whatever `sel_func` you choose. mizer generates the `"species, gear"` row names
for you:

```r
gear_params(params) <- data.frame(
    gear         = c("Otter", "Beam"),
    species      = c("Cod",   "Cod"),
    sel_func     = "sigmoid_length",   # recycled to both rows
    l50          = c(25, 20),          # 50% selected at this length (cm)
    l25          = c(20, 15),          # 25% selected at this length (cm)
    catchability = 1
)
```

If each species is caught by only one gear, you may instead put the gear columns
directly in `species_params` when building the model; mizer copies them into
`gear_params`. (Later edits to those `species_params` columns will **not**
propagate — edit `gear_params` after construction.)

## Selectivity functions

Every selectivity function takes `w` as its first argument and returns a value in
`[0, 1]` at each size. The other arguments must appear as columns in
`gear_params`:

| `sel_func` | Parameter column(s) | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `knife_edge` (default) | `knife_edge_size` | 0 below the size, 1 above (default size = `w_mat`) |
| `sigmoid_length` | `l50`, `l25` | smooth; lengths (cm) at 50% and 25% selection |
| `double_sigmoid_length` | `l50`, `l25`, `l50_right`, `l25_right` | dome-shaped (selects a length band) |
| `sigmoid_weight` | `sigmoidal_weight`, `sigmoidal_sigma` | smooth transition in weight |

`sigmoid_length` is the most commonly used. You can also write your own function
(first argument `w`, returns selectivity at size) and name it in `sel_func`.

```r
gp <- gear_params(params)
gp$sel_func <- "sigmoid_length"
gp$l50 <- 25            # 50% selected at 25 cm
gp$l25 <- 20            # 25% selected at 20 cm
gear_params(params) <- gp
```

## The selectivity and catchability arrays

Behind the scenes mizer turns the `gear_params` table into two numeric arrays,
the ones that enter the fishing-mortality formula directly. You can read them,
and — when a `sel_func` cannot express the shape you need — set them by hand:

| Function | Returns | Dimensions |
|---|---|---|
| `catchability(params)` / `getCatchability(params)` | `Q[g,i]` | gear × species |
| `selectivity(params)` / `getSelectivity(params)` | `S[g,i](w)` | gear × species × size |

The bare and `get`-prefixed names are equivalent. Each has a matching setter that
pushes an array straight into the model (this routes through `setFishing()`, so
validation still runs):

```r
selectivity(params)["Otter", "Cod", ]      # the S curve for one gear–species pair

sel <- getSelectivity(params)
sel["Otter", "Cod", ] <- my_curve          # length = number of size bins, in [0, 1]
selectivity(params) <- sel                 # triggers recalculation via setFishing()
```

Setting an array by hand **freezes** it: mizer marks it manual and stops
recalculating it from `gear_params`, so later edits to the gear table leave it
untouched (you'll see a message saying so). To discard the hand-set array and
rebuild from `gear_params`, call `setFishing(params, reset = TRUE)`.

## `setFishing()`

`setFishing(params, selectivity = NULL, catchability = NULL, reset = FALSE,
initial_effort = NULL, ...)` recomputes the fishing setup after a change.
Assigning `gear_params(params) <- ...` already triggers recalculation, so you
usually only call `setFishing()` directly when supplying a `selectivity` or
`catchability` **array**, setting a baseline effort, or rebuilding from scratch:

```r
params <- setFishing(params, initial_effort = c(Otter = 1, Beam = 0.5))
params <- setFishing(params, reset = TRUE)   # rebuild arrays from gear_params
```

## Baseline effort

The model stores a baseline effort per gear, read with `initial_effort(params)`
(a named vector) and set via `initial_effort(params) <- ...` or the
`initial_effort` argument of `setFishing()`. This is the effort used when
`project()` is called without an explicit `effort` argument.

```r
initial_effort(params) <- c(Industrial = 0, Pelagic = 1, Beam = 0.5, Otter = 0.5)
```

To vary effort **through time** in a run, pass a time × gear array to
`project()` — see the `run-simulation` skill.

## Catchability sets the units of effort

Because `F = S * Q * E`, only the product `Q * E` is pinned down by the fishing
mortality — so **catchability defines what one unit of effort means**. This gives
you two common conventions:

- **Effort = fishing mortality rate.** Set `catchability = 1`; then an effort of
  `E` produces `F = E` on fully-selected sizes. Simplest when you want to drive
  the model directly with F values (e.g. from a stock assessment).
- **Effort in real-world units** (vessel-days, kW-days, …). Fold the conversion
  into catchability: `Q` is the fraction of the selected stock taken per unit of
  whatever effort you supply. A useful trick is to set each species' catchability
  to its `F` in a chosen reference year, so an effort of 1 reproduces that year's
  fishing mortality and other years' efforts are relative to it.

Either way, if you rescale catchability you must rescale effort inversely to keep
the same `F`. This is why yield calibration (`calibrateYield`) depends on the
fishing setup being fixed first.

## Yield vs fishing mortality

`getYieldVsF()` and `plotYieldVsF()` — in **mizerExperimental**, not core mizer —
vary F for one species while holding the other species' fishing fixed. Each point
on the curve runs the model to steady state, so a curve is expensive:

```r
library(mizerExperimental)
y <- getYieldVsF(params, "Cod", F_range = seq(0.1, 1.2, 0.1))  # data frame: F, yield
```

Where the peak (F_MSY) sits is governed mainly by **density dependence in
reproduction**, not by the fishing setup. A higher `reproduction_level` (see the
`calibrate-model` skill) makes recruitment less sensitive to spawning stock, so
the species tolerates more fishing and the peak moves to higher F. The dependence
is monotonic, with nearly all of the movement happening as the level approaches
1 — so when tuning the level to place the peak, bisect in
`u = -log(1 - reproduction_level)`, not in the level itself.

Two limits to recognise before spending projections on a search:

- F_MSY is bounded above, reached at `reproduction_level` → 1. If the peak is
  still below the current F there, the model is saying the species is fished
  above F_MSY; reproduction is not what will fix it.
- For a species whose catchability is near zero (effectively unfished) the peak
  lies far above the current F at *every* reproduction level, and barely moves
  as the level changes.

To find only which side of the peak the current F lies on, compare the yield at
`F/1.25` and `F*1.25` — two projections instead of a whole curve. Tuning one
species shifts the other species' curves slightly, so re-check after a sweep.

## Checking the setup

```r
gear_params(params)                 # the gear table
catchability(params)                # Q array (gear × species)
selectivity(params)                 # S array (gear × species × size)
initial_effort(params)              # baseline effort per gear
plotFMort(params)                   # realised fishing mortality at size
getFMortGear(params)                # F by gear × species × size
```
